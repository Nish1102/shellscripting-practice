# Count Files Shell Script

This shell script counts the number of files in a specified directory.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
   git clone git clone https://github.com/Nish1102/shellscripting-practice.git

    ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd  shellscripting-practice/Day-02

    ```

3. **Make the Script Executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x count_files.sh
    ```

4. **Run the Script:**
    ```bash
    ./count_files.sh /path/to/directory
    ```

Replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual directory path you want to count files from.

## Script Details

- The script checks if a directory path is provided as an argument.
- It verifies if the provided directory exists.
- It then counts the number of files in the specified directory.

## Further Practice

Feel free to modify the script or create new ones based on your requirements. Some ideas for further practice include:

- Modifying the script to count files recursively.
- Adding functionality to count directories as well.
- Writing a script that calculates the total size of files in a directory.
- Developing a script that sorts files based on their size or modification time.

These exercises will help you practice various shell scripting concepts and commands.
