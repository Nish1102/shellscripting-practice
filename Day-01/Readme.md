# List Files Shell Script

This is a simple shell script that lists all the files in a specified directory.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone git clone https://github.com/Nish1102/shellscripting-practice.git

    ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd  shellscripting-practice/Day-01

    ```

3. **Make the Script Executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x list_files.sh
    ```

4. **Run the Script:**
    ```bash
    ./list_files.sh /path/to/directory
    ```

Replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual directory path you want to list files from.

## Script Details

- The script checks if a directory path is provided as an argument.
- It verifies if the provided directory exists.
- It then lists all files in the specified directory.

## Further Practice

Feel free to modify the script or create new ones based on your requirements. Some ideas for further practice include:

- Modifying the script to list both files and directories.
- Adding functionality to count the number of files or directories in the specified directory.
- Creating a script that checks if a given file exists in a directory.
- Writing a script that renames files in a directory based on a pattern.
- Developing a script that calculates the total size of files in a directory.
- Creating a script that searches for files containing a specific keyword within a directory.
- Writing a script that recursively lists files and directories in a given directory.
- Developing a script that compresses or archives files in a directory.
- Creating a script that deletes files older than a specified number of days in a directory.
- Writing a script that organizes files by moving them to different directories based on their extension.

These exercises will help you practice various shell scripting concepts and commands.
